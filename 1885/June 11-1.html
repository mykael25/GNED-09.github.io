			might make you uneasy about me, I shall answer you that I do everything possible to please you. For more than a year now and following my father's suggestions, I have withdrawn whenever it has been possible for me to do so and I have tried not to draw the attention of anybody to my person. I have been told not to write; well, I've dropped the pen, the only instrument that I had which I was beginning to wield not very badly; and if sometimes I've picked it up, it was because powerful reasons have compelled me to do so, and even then I've concealed my name out of love for that obscurity that I need so much. If in spite of this I still have enemies, well let them be! It is so difficult to live without troubles, but misfortune does not mean dishonor and misfortune is welcome if it will banish vilification and degradation. So long as we can keep the esteem of those who know us, so long as our conscience is not hostile to us in our meditations, what does the rest matter? We have been born in the midst of a society whose political life is so anomalous that we have no other hope but to submit or to succumb: Whichever is preferable conscience will decide. Let us then trust in God and in the sincerity of our intentions. If wishing and desiring the good brings misfortune as reward, what should we do? The greatest legacy that parents can bequeath to their children is rectitude in judgment, generosity in rights, and steadfastness in adversity; the greatest honor that a son can pay to his parents is integrity and a good name, that the acts of the son may never make his parents leave with indignation or shame, and the rest God will provide. Sorrows and miseries pass away with life and individuals; the family inherits the memory and blesses or curses the departed. I should like that just as I can . . . I can repeat and say aloud that I'm the son of the most honorable man and most pious women of my town, and may my parents never repent for having brought me into the world and if possible, may they at least feel satisfaction, if not pride, in mentioning me.

			Concerning what you say about my duties as a Christian, I have the pleasure to be able to answer you that I haven't stopped a moment in believing in the fundamental principles of our religion. To the beliefs of my childhood have succeeded the convictions of youth that with time will take root in me. A belief that cannot withstand examination and the test of time ought to pass on the memory and leave the heart. I must not try to live on illusions and falsehoods. What I believe in now, I believe rationally, and it is because my conscience cannot accept more than is compatible with reason. I can bow my head before an act that is mysterious to me whenever it doesn't exist in fact, but never before an absurdity nor before a probability. Religion to me is the most sacred thing, the purest, and most ethereal, that eschews all human adulterations and I believe that I would fail in my duty as a rational being if I would prostitute my reason and intelligence, his most precious gift. I believe that, in order to honor Him more, all I can do is to present myself to Him making use of the best that He has given me, in the same way that in presenting myself before my parents I should wear the best dress they have given me. If some time I shall come to possess that divine spark that is called knowledge, I would not hesitate to use it for the service of God, and if in my ratiocinations, I should not make a mistake, commit an error, God will not punish me. . .
