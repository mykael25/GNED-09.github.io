My dear parents,

			On the 1st of this month we gave up the house we had taken in order to be able to live more economically and freely and the three of us -- Ceferino, Lete, and I -- have moved to this new house which costs us almost double, for they charge us for the room alone two pesetas a day. As I don't intend to stay here more than 15 days, until the arrival of the mail boat on which I plan to depart, should I have money, I've paid the six pesos they asked me. It is possible, now that it seems my allowance will not be increased, that I may not go to England where the cost of living is much higher, but to Germany where they have assured me one can live at Berlin with the same allowance as here at Madrid. If this is true, as I'm assured, I'll do that. L And if I don't receive money, my fate will decide what it shall be. From Paris Valentin has sent me money, spending for money order fees and other things. It is a good and friendly gesture, but I believe it ought not to be abused.

			      German will be of the greatest usefulness to me in the future when German commerce and preponderance shall prevail over there in the neighboring regions. It is moreover a language few Filipinos possess. I know a little, but as all that I know I have learned by myself, it turns out that though I have facility in translating written German, on the other hand, I can't understand a single word when they speak to me, for my ears are not accustomed to the sound of the words.


		</p>

		<br>

		<p >
		      If I receive 200 pesos, I leave immediately for Germany; if I receive 600 pesos, I shall finish the doctorate, and if not, happen what may happen. I already owe three and a half months board. Since 1st July, when I should receive money, I have been without any and without letters.

			      I don't know how the Caroline question (1) will end. It seems that Bismark will get away with his pretensions. It is necessary that we prepare for what may happen so that we shall not be more exploited than we are now. Whenever they asked me here for our opinion I replied: "I believe that all Filipinos only want either to be Spanish or be independent." I don't know if I have interpreted correctly the wish of our countrymen, but if not, I suppose I haven't hurt them. When I was asked if we would fight in defense of the Spanish flag against the German, I answered them that we would always fight in fulfillment of our duty and in obedience to our conscience. "What then is your duty and what does your conscience dictate?" "Our duty", I replied, "is to love our country and our conscience dictates that we do everything that our duty implies."

			      As I haven't heard any news from there, it is difficult for me to speak of persons who are dead or have disappeared.<br><br>
      Those of the Filipino colony have not yet returned from their summer excursions. On the 1st of this month Vald√©s, Calero, and Cabangis, two physicians and one future one, left for home.

		</p>

		<br>

		<p>
			      If I had taken advantage of the summer to go abroad to study languages, as I did during the first year of my arrival in this by going to Paris, this summer I would have gone to Germany or Switzerland, and now I would be earning two pesos a day with gratuity in addition, for in the . . . .
