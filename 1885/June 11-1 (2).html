			And I haven't given any reason for it: To fear for me is to draw attention to me that is prejudicial, for I think only of treating and studying diseases. I believe that they ought to show a calm confidence, concomitant of innocence and security, for there will always be time to weep. And moreover our mother ought to have more confidence in that God whom they call just and to think at the same time that not all misfortunes make one unfortunate. There are misfortunes that make one happy. For this reason also I want to go home to prove that I fear nothing from anyone; there is no reason for it; that for the present I'm not yet exiled and I believe that the Spanish government, having already learned a lesson, will not punish this time an innocent man, for victims have the habit of haunting with their memory and killing for good the strongest powers. If you don't order otherwise, as for example, that I spend some months in England to study practical mechanics (3 months), in Germany, medicine and science, and an allowance equal to what I get now, if more is not possible, I shall go home and have the pleasure of finding myself among you, never to be separated again. However advantageous a foreign country may be for me, it is not so much that it could compensate for the very great sacrifice that you make for me. The previous letters I have written you abound with these ideas and I need your reply.

			You told me about the fire there at home. This fire starting from pyrotechnics has led me to a rather remote idea that we ought to think little by little of changing our customs making them more practical. You, for instance, with your prestige among the people there, ought to begin to instill in their minds the idea of abandoning festivals and other things that produce no immediate utility, such as Thanksgiving Masses and other things of the sort. The money that goes to certain coffers doesn't circulate and money that doesn't circulate brings about the impoverishment of the country. Furthermore, over there we are being exploited in every sense of the word and we ought to be tired of that now. Now that I think of the money that is spent on a feast, should that be used for the benefit of the people, would yield very much more profit.

			On your word I believe in the goodness of the curate, whom I greet from here, but an idea occurs to me. If the women of Calamba, having a curate who is not at all fanatical, through their own initiative are so fond of candles and images, what would become of them should a curate who is decidedly fanatical and an exploiter come and weigh on their consciences like the night and squeeze them like a press? You must agree that if our sex there is not so advanced, very much less so is the opposite sex that revolves and lives in that atmosphere that is found from the confessional to the sacristy and leads to great aberrations.

			At present there are here two Filipinos -- Messrs. Andrés and Arcaldio del Rosario. They are the type of the passing generation, but if it is passing, I believe that at least it sees the little lights that are beginning to shine. The other day Don Andrés was talking to me and he no longer maintains as at first certain axioms, he does not recognize any more the supposed facts, and at a dinner he declared himself on the side of youth and he offered a toast to it.

			      Here the cold is becoming intense, but I'm still without chilblains, which surprises me, for now it is colder than in previous years. Here there had been and there are still earthquakes; but although they aren't comparable with ours, on the other hand, they surpass them in their effects, for already . . . have sunk . . . monastery of the Middle Ages, and nothing more of value. That is all. This is so sure that we have here at present four lawyers, graduates of the Universidad Real y Pontificia de Manila (Real y Pontificia Universidad de Sto. Tomás de Manila) with very good grades, one of them being noted and famous for having practiced a long time. Placed in the midst of modern civilization they are like the Seven Sleepers for their naiveté and backwardness, and like country-folk in a ballroom. And if this happens to them at Madrid, which is not very distinguished for its culture and enlightenment, how would they appear amidst the people of France, England, and Germany where everyone reads the newspapers, where the middle class possess an education that the Manila aristocracy don't have not anything like it. If we recall what I told you about my landlady at Paris, that Mme. Lesjardins, the chubby and plump little woman, and her husband who know fairly well general history and particularly that of their country, geography, and mathematics, and speak and write their native tongue correctly, how many of those great lords, who hold high positions can say the same thing about themselves? And I'm assured the German people are even more so, and the English also. Thus, when we say here to a foreigner, introducing a friend: "The gentleman is a lawyer, he has been a judge, notary public, etc., etc.," he is stuck and he looks at him with a bit of surprise asking how laws can palpitate and how justice can have life under such unfavorable conditions.<br><br> And without going further, among my countrymen I'm considered one of the most studious and of sufficient ability, but when I compare myself with many young men I have known abroad, I confess frankly I see myself on a very much inferior level, and I deduce that in order to reach their height I need many years of study, much money, and much more ability, and those young men, notwithstanding, are younger than I. I don't mean the young men of this country among whom I know truly vulgar and it is not that they lack ability, no. They have much talent, much willingness, but the defective instruction makes them work hard though they profit less, as it happened to us over there; the kind of life they lead; cafés and billiard halls; the examples they see among the old ones and those who hold high positions; laziness and charlatan natures; the few inducements the government offers to scholars, like there too, with the sole difference that over there we would like the rulers not to meddle at all with the students but to leave them alone in peace; upon seeing that one rises to power through the tongue and intrigue, membership in this or that party -- all these contribute to the frustration of so many excellent abilities, so many young men who undoubtedly would amount to something if placed in another environment.<br><br> What I regret most is that many of our countrymen, already poisoned by this atmosphere, join parties against their conscience; seek glory through money and at the cost of ridicule, not through their own merit, but through banqueting and farces, not realizing that such a glory is a paper flame that produces ashes which only soil and stain afterward. For this reason, if the nephews must come, I would not want him to go to Madrid unless they have to study law for which it is indispensable and even convenient inasmuch as here are the best law professors that can be found in Spain, and as it is a profession in which language is a principal factor, I believe Madrid is the best school for it on account of the people's character in all its phases.

			At present, a classmate of mine is the physician Mr. Franco who was over there for a long time practicing his profession. He had been my professor, very notable above all for failing students, and who at the beginning of my course said he would fail all of us. Let Dandoy tell it when . . .
