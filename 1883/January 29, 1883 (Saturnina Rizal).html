				Madrid, 17 January 1883<br>

Mrs. Saturnina Rizal
<br>
My beloved Sister:

			</p>

		
<br>
		<div class="letter-content">
		<p >
			      I received your letter of 14 December and I thank you for it and the enclosure.
		</p>

		<br>

		<p >
			  I'm waiting for the picture of Freding (this nickname sounds German or English) and I'm hoping I would see him still a baby.
		</p>

		<br>

		<p >
			      I fear greatly that this letter would not find José the son of Marianito, alive because you said that his feet and hand were already cold. I presume that water should not always be used in the treatment of infants and those who know say so also; for really, if we apply a strong medicine to a young life, which is like a light that has just begun to flare, it will so weaken the patient that what is intended as remedy might only lead to the grave. We also use water often but only in cases where the patients are older, in treatment of women's diseases and others, and the treatment is not too prolonged. The death that results from water cure is not far from death caused by cold that is not obvious and painful but slow, like a candle burning.
		</p>

		<br>

		<p >
			May God save him and the water heal and not drown him. May my fear be merely a dream. <br><br>
      I thank you for the gift of a ring, handkerchiefs, and sandals. Don't expect any return just now.

		</p>

		<br>

		<p >
			  Please send me a list of friends and acquaintances who have died of the pest and beriberi.<br><br>
      I read in your letter that you are residing in the south because the house has been bought by Compadre Andres. Which house in the south?

		</p>

		<br>

		<p>
			      Remind Ursula and Victoria of the saving, of what use is forage if the horse is already dead. Even if they sang in church last Christmas, I regret that they thought of doing it when I was no longer there. I should like to thank them but not for this. Sweeter to my memory was the past when she could be urged to sing and play the harp. The name given by Father Ingó (Boema, Traford) is something I did not expect from such a priest. It is either too much or too little.
		</p>
		<br>

		<p>
			Also I praised Loleng's new industry; it is different from her former industry. Only I cannot understand why when I was there and we used to play revesino (card game) she did not think of making bibingka (rice cake). I have received conflicting news, but one stands out, unchanging. I thought that her most becoming dress is blue and gold stripes. Please tell her this.
		</p>
		<br>

		<p>
			I'm studying Italian and I can speak now a little. It is so very sweet that one is obliged to sing the words. When I go home, I'm going to teach it to Icang so that her tongue would become a little soft. If you only know it, we can correspond in it, instead of Tagalog, which is very difficult to write. Besides I'm a slow writer in Tagalog; I'm forgetting it; and my Tagalog is being spoiled by the pathetic way my companions speak it. I forget my Florante (1) in Barcelona. There is no one around with whom I can speak it properly. I read your letter again and again. I’m tired of the Spanish language.
		</p>
		<br>

		<p>
			I’m very, very grateful to Tonino and Sra. Sisa for the money they sent me. However, if I’m to be believed as I wish to be believed now, I beg you not to send me any more money. The source of this money is good but the effect is saddening. My other brothers who cannot send me money will be sorry because of their inability to do so. And if they would also send me, following the example of the others, I cannot accept it, except with regret, knowing that it has meant a great sacrifice for them. I don’t know if they can understand what I’m trying to say or if I say it correctly. Please try to explain it. Another thing is that for me even a little suffices. Why should they retrench to give me money? If I need money, I'm going to ask for it. Between us brothers, it is unnecessary to express our desires; we understand one another.
		</p>
		<br>

		<p>
			      Ordinarily, not all good desires and generosity produce sweet fruits. Your affection is enough for me. Take good care of yourselves so that we may meet again, like olden days when we used to go out fishing, to take a bath in Pansol (2) and Prinsa, go on a stroll, drink tuba (3) or visit Mainit. I don't know why all these things come back to my mind. I'm also very, very careful, as I don't wish to cause our father and mother any anxiety. Yesterday when I was returning from the barbershop a man who tried to rob me accosted me. All I did was wave him away, pushing him. In former days I cannot say what I would have done, especially as I was carrying a cane.
		</p>
		<br>

		<p>
			      Kiss for me the hands of father and mother and embrace our brothers for me. Give a kiss to Millong (if he is no longer cross-eyed), Icang, Toño, Delfina, Chabeng, José and Freding. Handsome lad or European eyes?
		</p>
		<br>

		<p>
			      Regards to our relatives and to all the young, ladies I know, especially to Loleng, Sula, and others, to Dandoy, the Curate, Father Ingó, Ate Colasa, Coya Sinforoso.
		</p>
		<br>

		<p>
			      This is all and your brother embraces you.
		</p>
		<br>
