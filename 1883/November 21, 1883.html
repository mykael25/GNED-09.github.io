				Madrid, 21 November 1883<br>

My Dear Parents and Brothers,
<br>

			</p>

		
<br>
		<div class="letter-content">
		<p >
			      Although it may seem strange, living in a city may also be monotonous, even if this city may also be monotonous, even if this city is called Madrid; but the truth is that leading a regulated life and not mixing in other people’s business is also monotonous and I have no news to give you. I am well and healthy as one can be in this cold weather and the chilblains that it produces.
		</p>

			Our fellow countryman Figueroa (1) who competed for the professorship of engraving at the Academia de San Fernando had the bad luck of being treated with the same very natural and common injustice as they did to another, because they preferred one whose works occupied the third place. In vain were the protests presented by the . . . (illegible) competitors and newspapers. The position was already assigned before the competition was held. I don’t know what this young man will decide to do now.

			      The crown prince of Germany will arrive here day after tomorrow. This event is given much importance and, it seems, may lead to a Hispanic-German alliance or German-Hispanic alliance. It is said that the war between France and Germany is inevitable. I believe that we shall witness stupendous things and events.
			      <br><br>
      Next June, when the academic year ends, I shall graduate in medicine. If you want me to get the degree of Doctor of Medicine, you should write me. It’s a matter of one year more and hundreds of pesos for fees.<br><br>
            Of the things that you sent me the guava jelly and the two jars of bagoong arrived in very good condition; the mango jelly was rather fair; the sotanjon, miqui, bijon, (2) etc. good; the rest were broken and spoiled.
            <br><br>
            We aren’t badly off in our little house. It only seems that the maids steal our petroleum for their light. But this is inevitable. The cold weather is late in coming, but the chilblains abound.
		</p>

		<br>

		<p >
			      You’ll probably receive this letter towards the end of this year. I therefore wish you a happier and better New Year than that of last year. Please tell it to my brothers-in-law and other relatives. For that date I expect some letters from you, because it is five months now that I don’t receive even a line from the family. I hear that letters are intercepted and you don’t receive my letters. Hence, I intend to stop writing until you inform me of what is happening to them. I’m so little informed of what is happening there that I don’t know if my sister Olimpia is living at home or in the town or at Taal; the same is true regarding Sra. Neneng and Sra. Sisa. It’s a little bothersome to find out these things from persons who are strangers and not close to us.
      With nothing more for now, I desire your well-being and good health. I send my regards to my brothers, brothers-in-law, friends, and relatives.

		</p>

			 One recent Sunday there was held here a republican demonstration. Four thousand men went to the tomb of Figueras, the first president of the Republic, to pay him homage. There they delivered speeches, letters were read, and they made protests. All of this was in the very center of the capital city. Such occurrences describe these communities.
