				Madrid, 17 December 1884<br>

My dear parents and brothers,
<br>


			</p>

		
<br>
		<div class="letter-content">
		<p >
			      Although the most important thing that I have to tell you, which is my return to those Islands was already mentioned in my previous two letters, nevertheless I wrote you this third one, fearful that on account of the singular condition of the system of communications there, my letters might have been lost and you are prevented from knowing my plans. Moreover, as the year ends with the joyful holidays of Christmas and the New Year, I wish you to celebrate them in the family with all my sisters, brothers-in-law, and nephews as when I was there. Such a celebration furnishes all the joys that the most splendid and sumptuous tables of the English lords can give. It is said that this holiday is the dearest to the English heart, which I believe they call Christmas, if I'm not mistaken.

			I noticed in my baptismal certificate that there is now a new parish priest -- Gabino de los Reyes. I don't know if he is a friar, but if we are to judge by the surname, he must be a Filipino, because that is not used here; I don't know anyone here with such a surname. If my conjectures don't turn out wrong, so much the better. In that way there will be less cause for trouble.
		</p>

		<br>

		<p >
			The school problem is getting worse. Castelar, Moret, Sagasta, Martos, Labra, Moyano, Comas, and Silvela are going to interpellate severely the government on these happenings that have caused so much harm. Five young men belonging to very good families have been punished by being dropped from the course. For this reason their parents are going to undertake an active campaign against this imprudent government and it is believed the government will fall. We haven't returned to our classes and the students of Rome, Parma, and Turin (Italy), Liege (Belgium), Coimbra (Portugal) and Vienna in Austria have done the same thing. I don't know how this will end. All of us who hold scholarships have lost them. I lost two in Arabic and Spanish Literature, which is unfair, inasmuch as these scholarships are acquired through competition rather than through favor. Much will be said about this also.
		</p>

		<br>

		<p >
			      I told you in my two previous letters that in view of the condition and future of our modest business, I don't wish to prolong further my stay in Europe, as I wanted to, for I believe that it must be very burdensome for the family. I laid it before your consideration. I told you that I was ready to go home as soon as possible, if you wish. Circumstances have changed in such a way that we ought to change our plans also, lest we suffer unfortunate and irreparable consequences. I told you that in view of the government's blunder, the Philippine sugar trade will inevitably die within two or three years, because the clever minister of colonies has just negotiated a treaty with the United States -- a death sentence for the Filipinos. We couldn't have fallen into better hands. If Sagasta or any other party except this, a party which is not so blind and ignorant, would come to power, perhaps this evil might be remedied somewhat. If we had deputies, a newspaper, or Filipino members in the Consejo de Filipinas (1) (Council of the Philippines) we would get something, or at least the imprudent steps taken by the clever minister of colonies, Mr. Tejada de Valdosera, could have been stopped.

			Tell me my sister Narcisa that her friend Maria Lecaroz is already married to Mr. Ordónez, director of welfare, and now they live at Madrid. They say that she speaks French, English, German, and Italian. She lives in the modern way.


		</p>

		<br>

		<p>
			      I'm in good health, thank God, and I wish you also to be like me or better. According to a letter I received in the month of June, my sister Olimpia was then on the family way. I suppose that at this date she must have already delivered. If I'm not mistaken, it is her first or second child. I'm so little informed of what is happening there that I hope she wouldn't be surprised or feel bad that I should not know if she is a mother or not. If her habits haven't changed yet, I fear very much for the skin of the boy: how many pinchings he will get.
		</p>
		<br>

		<p>
			      They have also written me -- I not responsible for the accuracy of the news -- that José, Marianito's son, and Angélica have died. That is really a pity and I sincerely regret it.
		</p>
		<br>

		<p>
			      I wish you to answer me, even though briefly, so that I may adjust my plan according to what you may resolve.
		</p>
		<br>

		<p>
			I forgot to add that as you owe me three months allowance, a friend of mine has been helping me all this time, sometimes to pay my matriculation fees, sometimes to pay for the house and food, because with fifty pesos one cannot make money miracles at Madrid. I would be grateful then to you should you send me that amount if I have to go home, so that I can settle my account with this good friend and he may have no cause to say absolutely anything about me. On a certain occasion I was able to render him a little service in gratitude for which he has wanted to come to my assistance in all my difficulties, always lending me money whenever I needed it. And as here in Europe one has to be dressed all day from the moment one rises to the time one goes to bed, as one must use strong and double clothes on account of the climate, we have to get clothes every year and every season. Here nothing is done for charity. There is a story here about a gentleman who, meeting a tired Galician who could neither walk nor take a step, taking pity on him, invited him to ride horseback with him. The Galician did so and after a few seconds he said to the good gentleman: "Señuritu, cuantu vuy ganaudu?" (Master, how much do I earn?)
		</p>
		<br>

		<p>
			      I wish you to keep always well and healthy in the company of the family, all enjoying the joy and festivities of these days.
		</p>
		<br>

		<p>
			      Your son and brother who embraces you,
		</p>
		<br>
