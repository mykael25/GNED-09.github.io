				Madrid, 16 November 1884<br>

My dear parents and brothers,
<br>

			</p>

		
<br>
		<div class="letter-content">
		<p >
			      Enclosed with Uncle Antonio's letter of 1st October I received the sum of 50 pesos corresponding to my allowance for September, if I'm not mistaken in my calculations. I'm matriculated in eight subjects and I try to study them as best I can. I'm in good health and I wish you would be the same.
		</p>

		<br>

		<p >
			      The news that arrived here from that dear country concerning commercial as well as social life is very distressing and it prompts me to write you the following considerations. The future of Philippine sugar will go from bad to worse. A few days ago I was at the house of Mr. P. Ortiga who is at present working, according to him, to see if the minister of colonies can make the damage to our commercial fortune the least possible. You should know more or less that, as a result of the present situation or the attitude of Cuba, the Spanish Government, always mindful of the welfare of its colonies, is negotiating a treaty with the United States for the free entry of Cuban and Puerto Rican sugar into the New York market.<br><br> England, informed of this, is also taking steps that the same privilege be granted to her colonies. Neither do you ignore that the only markets of Philippine sugar are New York, London, and Spain that it enters thanks to a big surcharge. If England succeeded in entering into this treaty, Cuban and Puerto Rican sugar will also have to be admitted to London and therefore, Philippine sugar, after a long voyage, paying high freight and duties, will be in a very unfavorable position and in little demand in the markets of the Peninsula, America, and England, and hence its complete and total ruin. <br><br>This is what Don Pablo was saying to me. He is drafting a memorial to be presented to the learning minister of colonies to see if at least the duties that the Philippines pay could be reduced to one half and from which Cuba had been completely exempted, in order that this dear Spanish colony of the Orient may not be ruined rapidly, for instance, in less than three years. This is truly hard, but thanks to this profoundly wine measure, the integrity of our native land may be saved, which is the most precious thing for us to look after. <br><br>Thanks to it Cuba will not again adopt such a menacing attitude that, though it may be rich in results, on the other hand, it is very painful for us who have different sentiments and preserve in our hearts indelible memories of benefits received. Don Pablo, however, has little hope in the favorable result of his efforts and fears that things will not continue as they are. I, fully aware of these circumstances, wish to return as soon as possible to our town to avoid more sacrifices on the part of our modest family.<br><br> If at another time I accepted its support, it was because the future was smiling on us; but now that times have changed, I believe that it is my duty to go home and try with my work and savings to contribute as much as possible to our livelihood. To my way of thinking, the training that I have is enough for me to live in a town like Calamba, certain that they'll not include me among the dullest. <br><br>Without doubt my aspirations were very high and alluring, but more than aspirations they were the dreams of my youth and their realization would be madness, if not censurable egoism. Never in truth did I believe myself incapable of carrying out this or that idea or undertaking and I have relied much on the faculties with which Nature has endowed me; but this is no . . . .
